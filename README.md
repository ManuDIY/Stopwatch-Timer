#Stopwatch Timer

Stopwatch Timer is a project written in JAVA that allows the user to spin up `n` stopwatches where `n` is a number that they provide.

Each stopwatch supports the ability to `start` `stop` and `reset`.

When a stopwatch is `started`, the time to the right of the stopwatch indicator begins to increase by the millisecond until the user elects to reset or `stop` it. 

Buttons are grayed out with logic to prevent the user from `starting` and already `started` stopwatch or `resetting` a new stopwatch. 

When a stopwatch is `started` the color indicator to the left of the `stopwatch indicator` turns green. When it is `stopped`, it turns red.
